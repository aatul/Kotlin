/*
Public modifier is accessible from anywhere in the project workspace. 

If no access modifier is specified, then by default it will be in the public scope. 

In all our previous examples, we have not mentioned any modifier, hence, all of them are in the public scope. 

Following is an example to understand more on how to declare a public variable or method.
